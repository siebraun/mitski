        <h1>ABOUT</h1>

        <p>
          A singer and songwriter known for both candid lyrics and a catchy yet
          volatile version of indie rock, Mitski is short for Mitsuki Miyawaki.
          Mitski was born in Japan to an American father and Japanese mother on
          September 27, 1990. Miyawaki moved around during her youth, living in
          over 13 countries around the world, before graduating from high school
          in Turkey. She attended college in the United States, first enrolling
          at Hunter College in New York City to study film before transferring
          to SUNY Purchase for music composition.

          Her sonic idiom was guitar-heavy, crunchy and melodic, somewhere
          between Liz Phair and the Pixies. Lyrically, she could sketch in an
          entire relationship with a few details—socks on a bed, an Austin
          breeze, Charles Reznikoff on the brain. And then she could deliver a
          hook that lodged itself like a hatchet: “I want a love that falls as
          fast as a body from the balcony,” she sings on “Townie.” “I want a
          kiss like my heart is hitting the ground.”
